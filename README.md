# 🧠 EU Policy Compliance Checker (GenAI Final Project)

An intelligent **Regulatory Compliance Assistant** that analyzes projects, company policies, or legal questions related to **European law, GDPR, AI Act, and NIS2**, and generates:
- ✅ A **concise legal answer** directly in the chat  
- 🧾 A **detailed compliance report** in PDF format  
  (including compliance score, risk analysis, and actionable steps)

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with `Chroma` and `OpenAI Embeddings`
- **Automatic PDF report generator** (formatted and structured)
- **Interactive chatbot** built with [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/)
- **Dual-level intelligence**:
  - Short in-chat response for fast understanding
  - Full structured PDF with executive summary, compliance score, and next steps
- **Dynamic prompt logic**: no score is generated for general questions, only for detailed policy/project evaluations

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone & setup environment
```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd "Final project AI"
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Add your OpenAI API Key

In app.py, set:

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxx..."

### 3️⃣ Run the app locally
chainlit run app.py -w

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a legal question or uploads policy content.

2. The app retrieves relevant EU legal texts using ChromaDB.

3. GPT-4o-mini analyzes and synthesizes the legal context.

4. The chatbot provides a short answer.

5. A full compliance report is generated (PDF).

## 📊 Evaluation Phase

A dedicated evaluation.ipynb notebook is provided to:

- Test the RAG pipeline across various queries

- Compare GPT answers vs expected legal interpretations

- Store results in a CSV for performance analysis

## 🧪 Example Query

Question:

    Can I store photos of employees for internal authentication?

Chat Answer:

    Yes, you can store photos of employees for internal authentication under GDPR, but you must adhere to specific legal requirements: ...
